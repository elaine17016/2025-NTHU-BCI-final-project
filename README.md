## 1. Introduction

BCI (Brain-Computer Interface), this technology holds great potential for assisting individuals with physical disabilities, particularly through the use of MI (Motor Imagery). While MI-BCI systems often require extensive user training, we explore whether DL (Deep Learning) can improve signal recognition, especially for inefficient users, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness and accessibility of MI-based BCI applications.

This study focuses on developing and evaluating more effective classification techniques for differentiating between left-hand and right-hand motor imagery tasks.

## 3. Model Framework
First, we use EEGLAB for initial data preprocessing.

Next, we apply preprocessing.m in MATLAB to perform advanced preprocessing steps and retrieve the resulting .mat file.

Then, we conduct machine learning. Besides SVM, we also use other models such as KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost etc.

## 4. Validation
In a quest to verify the reliability and generalizability of our BCI classification model, we used the following approaches:

1. Train-Test Split: We first divided the dataset into a training set and a test set using an 80/20 stratified split for balancing classes. This allowed us to test the performance of the model on unseen data.

2. Cross-Validation: For the training set, Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5) was used to prevent overfitting and to test the models' stability. Using the stratified approach guarantees that every fold has the same proportion of left-hand and right-hand motor imagery trials.

3. We performed EEG data standardization using StandardScaler prior to training to normalize the features and enhance SVM performance.

4. Metrics Used: We added accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for left-hand and right-hand classes, giving a comprehensive assessment of classification performance.

These validation methods collectively build confidence in the goodness and strength of the designed model.
## 5. Usage
Here, we introduce the usage of svm.py.

1. **Environment Setup**  
   In order to execute our BCI classification code, make sure to have the following environment:  
   - Python version: 3.8+

2. **Required Libraries:**
```bash
pip install numpy h5py scipy scikit-learn
```

3. **Dataset**

   Download and preprocess the EEG dataset with EEGLAB and preprocessing.m in MATLAB to create MI_3.mat.

4. **How to Run?**

   Put the file MI_3.mat in the current working directory.

   Run the classification script:

```bash
python svm.py
```

## 6. Results
### üß† Why we choose 7-30Hz? Comparison of EEG Frequency Bands on Machine Learning Performance

##  Recommendation

- The **7‚Äì30 Hz** band performs best, with both validation and test accuracy reaching **91%**.
- The **1‚Äì50 Hz** range includes high-frequency noise, slightly degrading validation performance.
- The **7‚Äì13 Hz** band focuses on alpha rhythms, which may not fully capture the motor imagery signals, resulting in slightly lower accuracy.

> We recommend using the **7‚Äì30 Hz** frequency band for optimal model training and evaluation.

## Model Comparison
üß†To evaluate the classification performance of different machine learning models (trained with 7‚Äì30 Hz filtered EEG data), we compare SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN using several metrics:

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision (L/R)  | Recall (L/R)  | F1-score (L/R) |
|---------------|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **SVM**       | **0.89** | 0.91 / 0.87      | 0.87 / 0.92   | 0.89 / 0.90    |
| Random Forest | 0.84     | 0.87 / 0.82      | 0.81 / 0.88   | 0.84 / 0.85    |
| XGBoost       | **0.86** | 0.88 / 0.83      | 0.82 / 0.89   | 0.85 / 0.86    |
| KNN           | 0.74     | 0.81 / 0.69      | 0.62 / 0.86   | 0.71 / 0.77    |

## ERP Analysis at Channel C3
To further explore the neurophysiological basis of motor imagery, we analyzed the event-related potential (ERP) at channel **C3**, a region typically associated with motor function.

- **Left-hand ERP (C3)**  
  ![ERP Left](image/ERP(C3_left).png)

- **Right-hand ERP (C3)**  
  ![ERP Right](image/ERP(C3_right).png)

Although both conditions evoked clear ERP responses, the right-hand imagery elicited a slightly stronger negative deflection around 300‚Äì600 ms, which aligns with the known contralateral role of C3 in processing right-hand motor activity. This finding reinforces the physiological validity of our EEG-based features.
